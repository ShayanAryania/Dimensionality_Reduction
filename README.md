What Is Dimensionality Reduction?
Dimensionality reduction refers to the method of reducing variables in a training dataset used to develop machine learning models. The process keeps a check on the dimensionality of data by projecting high dimensional data to a lower dimensional space that encapsulates the ‘core essence’ of the data.

Machine learning requires many sources and computations to analyze data with millions of features. Besides, it also involves a lot of manual labor. Dimensionality reduction makes this complex task relatively easy by converting a high-dimensional dataset to a lower-dimensional dataset without affecting the key properties of the original dataset. This process reveals the data pre-processing steps undertaken before beginning the training cycle of machine learning models.

Let’s say you train a model that can forecast the next day’s weather based on the current climatic variables such as the amount of sunlight, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and several other environmental factors. Analyzing all these variables is a complex and challenging task. Hence, to accomplish the task with a limited set of features, you can target only specific features that show a stronger correlation and can be clubbed into one.

For instance, we can combine the humidity and temperature variables into one dependent feature as they tend to show a stronger correlation. With such a clubbing method, dimensionality reduction compresses complex data into a simpler form and ensures that the end objective is achieved without losing the data’s crux. Today, businesses and firms such as DataToBiz are leveraging data analytics solutions such as data visualization, data mining, and predictive modeling that employ dimensionality reduction to maximize their business ROIs.

With the growing online and social media platforms, the number of internet users has risen exponentially. According to a September 2022 report by Statista Research Department, there are over five billion internet users worldwide. Such a solid user base generates a tremendous amount of data daily. 

A recent report by Finances Online predicts that by the end of 2022, we will produce and consume around 94 zettabytes of data. This may include data collected by Facebook (likes, shares, and comments), Amazon (customers’ buying patterns, clicks, and views), smartphone apps (users’ personal information), IoT devices (daily activity and health data of users), and even casinos (track every move of the customer).

Such a variety of data is fed to machine learning and deep learning models to learn more about the trends and fluctuations in data patterns. As this data has several features and is generated in vast amounts, it often gives rise to the ‘curse of dimensionality.’

Additionally, large datasets are accompanied by an inevitable sparsity factor. Sparsity denotes the ‘no-value’ features that can be ignored while training a model. Moreover, such features occur redundantly in the given dataset and pose issues while clustering similar features.

To address this curse of dimensionality, dimensionality reduction is resorted to. Its advantages include:

With the elimination of redundant data, lesser space for assumption remains, thereby elevating the overall accuracy of the machine learning model.
Significant control over the usage of computational resources. As a result, it saves time and budget.
Some ML and deep learning techniques do not perform well with high-dimensional data. This can be taken care of by reducing the dimensions of data.
Non-sparse data is crucial to derive statistical results as clean data ensures accurate and easier clustering, unlike sparse data.
